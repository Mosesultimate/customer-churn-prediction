# 🧠 Customer Churn Prediction  
Predict which customers are likely to leave your business using machine learning.

## 📌 Overview  
This project builds a **customer churn prediction pipeline** that ingests customer data, trains ML models, and produces churn probabilities. It is designed for easy experimentation, deployment, and integration with real-world systems.

## ✨ Features  
- 🔍 **Data preprocessing** (cleaning, encoding, scaling)  
- 📊 **Exploratory data analysis**  
- 🤖 **ML models** (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
- 🧪 **Hyperparameter tuning**  
- 📈 **Model evaluation** with clear metrics  
- 🚀 **Deployment-ready** model artifacts
